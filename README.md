ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a professional with a background in surveying and a strong passion for IT, particularly in Python and experimenting with new AI tools like language models. 
Currently, I'm working at Ocean Infinity, a tech company trying to achieve remote operations at sea.

ðŸ”§ My IT-projects are mostly a hobby, but some have made it to implementation. Some of them are:

* Folder management scripts to keep our data organized.
* An autologger for efficient log management.
* An image detection tool that stores data in Excel.
* A custom grapher and logger for Veripos systems.
* Analytics on logs and creating dashboards for survey operations.
* Currently concept testing for automated daily summaries of logs for clients, eliminating the need for manual review.
